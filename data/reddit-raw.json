        "selftext": "Look guys, this is pretty simple. \n\nSpaceX wants to go public at an eye-watering $1.5 _trillion_ valuation. What are the earnings for this out-of-this-world company? [$8 Billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/spacex-generated-about-8-billion-profit-last-year-ahead-ipo-sources-say-2026-01-30/). That gives us a PE ratio of, checks notes, 187.  (Edit: I've been informed in the comments that 8B is EBITDA, not earnings, so the PE ratio is probably north of 300. NOICE.)\n\nNow, this is 2026, PE ratios are about as relevant as a telegraph operators fingering speed, but still, there must be _some_ narrative to command such a rocketship valuation, right?\n\nAh, yes. Datacenters in space. \n\nSure, Elon is the world's biggest bullshit factory, but at least most of his bullshit looks appetizing if you squint. Self driving cars? Yeah! Robotaxis? Sure! Humanoid sexdolls? Why not!\n\nBut what the fuck is a DATACENTER IN SPACE good for. We've got datacenters at home, goddamit. \n\n(Of course, it goes without saying that the whole X.ai acquisition is a shit tamale wrapped in a shit sandwich, a shitducken so to speak, but whose counting shit here).\n\nHere is my prediction. Unlike you highly regarded turd chompers, IPO investors are a legitimately sophisticated bunch. There will be a roadshow, and pension funds, endowments, etc will actually have to _smell_ the shit before chomping on it.\n\nAnd I don't think they will. \n\nSo instead of the famously diamond-handed Punxatawney Teachers Union buying a chunk of the IPO, it will be desperate buyers of ~~hand grenades~~ hot potatoes who just want to watch it pop like god's asterisk on poppers at the adult cinema before shifting it to the next victim.\n\nNow, that may be irrelevant when the pop is for fucking _figma_, but we're talking SpaceX here. _Elon_. Either the IPO doesn't happen or when it does it will drop like the challenger shuttle.\n\nAnd people will panic. \n\nThe entire AI narrative that has been holding on our K-shaped economy will bl",

Every $100 invested returns $10. Take away 2% for inflation (even if you think it is higher, just do it for the sake of the math) and you get the 8% return he was talking about.\n\n```3,000,000 * 0.08 == 240,000```\n\nSo the original poster could be sitting on his ass making $240k a year, inflation adjusted, but instead burned more than half of it on gambling with options.\n\nAs for what you need to do in order to start a portfolio, max out your 401k, Roth IRA and all that, just go to the r/fire sub and ask, or read the posts there.\n\nAs for options, well, I think you should forget about them and run far away from them.

It barely meets the minimum public float requirement of $5 million (which was raised by the sec to $15 million two weeks ago, so the sec is not doing nothing, they increased the cost or creating a pump and dump scam going forward).\n\nAnother requirement for listing on nasdaq is minimum net profit of $750k in prior fiscal year.  Guess what it was for ANPA in 2024?  $820k.\n\nA third requirement for listing on nasdaq is market cap of $50 million.  Guess what it was when anpa ipo?  Exactly $50 million lol.\n\nThis company is literally created to meet minimum nasdaq listing requirements, as a vehicle for a pump and dump scheme.\n\nWith only 1.25 million public float, and a questionable underwriter that probably allocated a lot of that public float to insiders, it won’t take much liquidity to move the stock.\n\nThis stock would have been promoted in WhatsApp and WeChat investment groups, with predictions of stock movement.  These predictions would have been extremely accurate, because the insiders control the float.  To the “investors” in the chat groups, (pigs in Chinese term, since this is literally a pig slaughter farm), the “advisors / analysts” look invincible.  So they put in more and more money.  Once insider lockup expires, they would start liquidating their original shares for real cash.\n\nMoney can be made in the early stages of a pig slaughter farm scheme, because they need to pump it initially to establish credibility in the chat groups.  If you can be disciplined and not greedy, you can pick up some gains.  You just don’t know when the rug will be pulled.  Look at $CCHH, that’s a failed pump and dump that crashed too early for whatever reason, before insiders could cash out. \n\nI gotta say, this “acquisition” to pump is quite innovative.  The order book for this stock will have no support.  It may be some orders in the $80s, then crash to single digits, maybe less.  These charts all look the same.  When the rug is pulled, it’s 90% plus decline, most of the time to below $1.\n\nKhaby Lame has likely already been paid off in another way to participate in this scheme, probably crypto.  His exit is not from selling shares of this company.  I bet there are terms in the deal that he gets all his rights back when the rug is pulled on this stock.",

Even if they do, to most investors he will be viewed as a victim who lost billions on paper.\n\nFor him, probably a situation of bird in hand vs two in the bush kind of thing. \n\nPut option and shorts are too expensive given the volatility.  I think this will inevitably crash to penny stock status but you can go broke before it does.\n\nThe only safe-ish way to make money from these companies is the initial month or two from ipo where the pumpers are pumping.

It's not the end of the world. It'd be the end of the world to lose 60k in a retirement fund at the age of 63 or something - different story.\n\nEdit : Figured id add, the caveat is that you spend time learning and growing - not just throwing money into the wind eg 0dte's daily or some shit.",

They would prefer to run one or two people fewer than the shift needs to keep it clean and organized, people often pulling double duty (cashiers also cleaning the dining room/bathrooms, managers getting stuck in positions, etc.) They also had very little infrastructure for training it was basically “let the most recently promoted 19 year old pothead train the next one” …I mean “train your replacement.” And don’t get me started on how often they transferred managers. Stable leadership team? Never heard of her.\n\nI worked hard there for 3.5 years, was promoted twice and worked in 5 locations (transferred thrice, once while on vacation out of the country.) It was *always* a struggle and never once did we feel like things were going particularly well for more than a week or two.",

It's interesting actually, the sub got flooded with new users around the GameStop era, and a lot of OG creators either got sick of it and quit or found that it became harder to gain traction on posts. If I had to guess the reason for the latter, I would attribute it to new users not understanding and/or relating to the somewhat complex topics that many would base their videos around. \n\n\nTo support this, my best video post was in that time; and despite not discussing ANY market specifics or the like, it got something like 175,000 upvotes lmao. Basically, WSB used to be made up of more experienced market-goers, and then when the general audience took over the OG vids just didn't translate well. \n\n\nThere is good news though! Now that the sub has settled, you're seeing more people who A) have become familiar with these topics and B) yearn for the now nostalgic, pre-ape era. This post doing decent numbers supports that. For the time being, I'll keep making these to hopefully inspire more new creators, just as those before inspired me. \n\n\nAnywho, sorry for the long-ass reply, it's just a topic I've thought about a good amount haha",

Op could have calls in many different tech companies or even just qqq. They're saying they think everything tech is going down. As for me I think the notion is retarded and Nvidia couldn't possibly be in a stronger position to continue growing but that's just me.

The article has a quote like \"they've been using our chips for the past 10 years lol they're gonna keep using our chips\" (paraphrased).

Basically the world is sprinting away from US tech because they now view it as a significant, imminent, existential national security risk. Crypto is also caught up in this. It's causing a lot of shocks because the sudden sell-off is evaporating a lot of wealth very quickly, making people even more cautious and risk-averse, which in turn makes people run away from speculative US tech assets even faster.\n\nI doubt it will improve in the near term. Remember, Europe is now treating US tech as a malevolent, hostile force that threatens its sovereignty. France has announced they're moving away from US communications tech, Poland wants to stop using MS Office for government work, the EU doesn't want Palantir or Anduril anywhere near it anymore, etc. Canada will probably follow.

Since the 60s, pay hasn't increased with inflation, even if it should do so, so it becomes comparatively more difficult to purchase the same asset as shown in 2021.\n\nWe also want to keep some things in mind:\n\nMin wage in 1950: $1 or $11.84 today\n\nMin wage today: $7.25 (federally, we don't want to get into specific states right now)\n\nIn addition, we want to note that in 1950, each dollar was exchangeable upon request for just over 1 troy oz silver (it was roughly 90 cents per oz). Meaning that today, the min wage would have been about $70 last year. \n\nOf course, it's not 1:1 because there is speculation involved, but if you follow the exercise, someone making min wage in 1950 was earning about $2,000 a year assuming 40 hour weeks and 50 weeks of working (2 weeks vacation). Nominally, according to inflation, this is only about $26,000 per year. If that were paid in silver, that would equate to $140,000 today.\n\nSo it depends how you're looking at it, whether it's raw value of the dollar or what that dollar can actually do relative to assets (yes, I know that's basically how inflation is calculated, but not really here)",

It's because the expected returns from business keep going up. This got even worse after Covid, where inflation and quantitative easing synthetically gave most Americans a huge pay cut. The pay cut itself could have helped with exports, but instead businesses got accustomed to even higher returns. The stock market now expects those level of returns and will punish corporations for smaller returns.\n\nSo, we have this ouroboros economy, where the stock market is eating everyone's wages, everyone's wages are going into the stock market as 401ks increasingly into passive investments, and that cycle is ultimately driving imports down and wrecking the economy.\n\nA weaker dollar doesn't immediately and necessarily lead to a higher CPI.

So, there's a race to have higher EPS, lower wages, but take the profits. There's a multiplier effect as companies pass on the cost plus to the next company in the manufacturing chain. The net result is that American stuff is wildly expensive to import and no one can really do anything about it without complete vertical integration.

So the magnitude of such correction is defined by the total size of leveraged positions. Non-leveraged can hold the bag, leveraged have no choice in the matter.\n\nThe chart shows this: the \"knee\" where chart shifts gear is the level at which leveraged liquidity bought in. I marked the days when these shifts happened in PSLV, also the day (or level, \\~50) when volume hard-switched from physical (PSLV) to leveraged (AGQ). That is the level where selloff may land on hard floor - PSLV will not sell its stash now, not at 50 silver.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqptr4h06ahg1.png?width=3440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b131ce31544e074463abd8ec08eebab8d304774",

What is this safe harbour ? It says (at a different place in the budget pdf) 15% safe harbor on cost.

Here we are, and I'm still in disbelief when I check the account total.\n\nI mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude.\n\nI'm now trading nat gas (probably too big of a position), but no aggressive trades and definitely no more 0 DTE\n\nI just want to say: if you're down big atm, there's still a chance. It isn't going to be easy (I've spent every day/night hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets) but there's a chance you can come back. None of this is worth the stress though. That post-nut clarity once you've made it back is pretty sick though.\n\n\\[the large P/L for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $4900 on Friday - as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x...believe it or not those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $4700.\\]",

I find that misleading. Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn’t signal a strong dollar especially not merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place.\n\nWhat we need is real fiscal progress, not just new faces saying things are improving. I’m not convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem.\n\nGiven the current circumstances, is it an exaggeration to call the dollar ‘ becoming strong’?",

To maintain reserve currency status, a country will inevitably run a trade deficit, NOT a fiscal deficit, which is what the OP is talking about. This is known as the Triffing dilemma and it just comes down to supply and demand for the currency. More demand for the currency will increase its exchange rate. This has the effect of making imports relatively cheaper than exports and so the country ends up importing more than it exports, aka, a trade deficit. It is perfectly possible to to have a trade deficit without a fiscal deficit. ",

            "body": "They are both part of the problem. The Fed doesn't have the balls to raise interest rates to actual levels needed to crush inflation like they did under Volcker. The bar tender (the Fed) should be cutting off the alcoholic (the US) but only makes token-level adjustments to interest rates. Rates today are still below historic norms.\n\nAlso, the Fed kept rates too low for too long during the pandemic. They have admitted this. The government then said, \"we would be a fool not to take advantage of this cheap money\" which is why you see an explosion of the debt at that time.\n\nBut apparently Congress \"forgot\" that rates don't stay low forever, and that they will be paying \\*much\\* more for that debt once it rolls over at higher interest rates. The treasury didn't even have the foresight to lock-in that debt with a longer maturity, and issued a large portion of that debt with short-term treasuries instead of 30 year treasuries. Meaning that this short-term debt is soon rolling over at much higher interest rates which the country can't afford.\n\nAnd now the Fed can't raise interest rates even if it's the right thing to do to fight inflation, because doing so would cause the government to default on its debt obligations, and/or institute extreme austerity measures. The Fed regularly claims how it's independent and above politics, but the reality of the US debt situation undermines that independence.\n\nFurther evidence for this is how the Fed has been saying it has an \"average 2% annual inflation target\", and aggressively pursued low interest policies from 2008 onward (and then QE after that) in order to meet that 2% average after years of sub-2% inflation. And yet now when the shoe is on the other foot, they have no desire to average out those high pandemic inflation numbers with lower ones (below 2%) in order to bring the average back to 2%.\n\nThat's also why it doesn't really matter much who is nominated for Fed chair, they are still bound by the same realities of the US debt situation and will act accordingly. Most currencies in history (and every reserve currency) follows a long-term debt cycle of decreasing interest rates until the system collapses, and there is little evidence that this time will be any different. There is a great animated video on YT by Ray Dalio that goes into more detail about this called \"How The Economic Machine Works\".",

Germany is the world's 3rd largest Economy and it's GDP is is roughly $5 trillion. America only has 340 million people. The USA doesn't need to collect more taxes, it has a spending problem and wastes money. Why do we spend 3 times as much on medical costs for the same procedures as other countries...hint it goes into the pockets of middle men. USA is literally the richest guy on the block who doesn't have any savings because he buys a new car every year, a boat, jet skis and refinances his house every 5 years the second he gets equity. The main reason we are seeing more unrest in the USA is because the housing prices have sky rocketed and young people can't afford to buy homes in many cities. Since they can't afford a home, they feel that the system is rigged and place the blame on people richer than them- this is misplaced energy that is leading to a class and civil war, leading to the embrace of socialism and even communism in the election of Mamdani. The irony is- it's not rich people causing home prices to move, it's because enough homes weren't and aren't being built to keep up with population growth. The reason for this is mostly due to Democratic policies of over regulation and people that already have homes voting against measures to build new homes- the \"NIMBy\" or not in my back yard. Places where building is easy are affordable- notably in Texas, Tennessee, Florida and Arizona. Democratic cities like San Francisco have made it so hard to build that not enough homes are built, but more people keep moving there, so naturally the price goes up. Tokyo is bigger than any US city, and housing is very affordable- because it's easier to build and they build up instead of out. San Francisco just tried to put in a public urinal on the street for homeless people, and it never got finished at a price of $1.7 million...think about that, $1.7 million for a toilet because it had to go through countless layers of regulation and engineers, with each layer having middle men that need to be paid. IN LA- roughly 1100 homes were destroyed in the fires last year, less than 50 have been rebuilt, not a single one in Malibu. That is literally a policy failure, the people in Malibu and Palisades can afford to rebuild, they're not being allowed to, having to wait years for permits. California's Democratic over regulation has literally made it a failed state- China can build a hospital in days and California can't re-build single family homes in one year. The hilarious part is that Trump is such a dick, that it makes everyone hate Republicans, so instead of looking at what is actually causing the housing crises, we're blaming the bad guys and voting in more socialist and leftist ideology...which will lead to even more over regulation and even further the housing crises. Rich people will not pay more taxes than they have to, so they will just move. The truth is we need both Democrats and Republicans- California is a failed state because it's over regulated- it's gone too far left to get any thing done. On the other hand, I live in Arizona, and it's so un-regulated, they let farmers grow alf alfa, the most water intensive crop there is, out in the desert. Currently, 70% of Arizona water goes to farming, during the midst of a water shortage...that's obviously stupid and too little regulation. Most of our problems need a solution in the middle, but currently in America there is no common sense, no ability to compromise and no comprehension of nuance. It's really sad because if people just used common sense and kindness, everyone's lives would be better. BTW, I'm a registered Democrat, who votes Democrat, but i'm just not brain washed enough to go along with everything my preferred party does- I long for the 90s when both sides worked with each other and compromised to do what was best for the country.",

This is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the debt, and can be largely explained by Baby Boomers being in their prime working years in the 90s, and almost totally retired now. The math on these programs was short-sightedly predicated on each generation being bigger than the one that preceded it, so even after the Boomers are dead this problem will persist.\n\nTaxes are another component, but less than people think. Tax brackets have varied wildly over the past 70 years, but the federal government has *never* taken in more than 20% of GDP in taxes, and even then only in unusual windfall years like the dot com boom in the late 90s when capital gains were extraordinarily high, usually averaging around 15-16%. A secular deficit of 3-4% is crushing, there’s no way that GDP growth can exceed that for a sustained period of time, especially since interest is rising steadily YoY.",

But when they target whole countries, and are changing constantly, with no apparent logic behind it, then planning is impossible.  Also the administration has made U.S. products, both hardware and software less attractive, simply because they are from the U.S.  How likely is a European for example to buy a Tesla or Ford or GMC car now when there is such a stigma attached to the U.S., or how likely is Europe to want to use data centers in the U.S. or even data centers in Europe run by U.S. companies, when they have no idea what the future holds for their safety.

Tariffs on materials raise manufacturing costs, which foreign manufacturers don't have to pay. Tariff uncertainty prevents business from making both short and long term investments. ",

            "body": "It wasn't inefficient, it was sold off by investors to instead use what is basically overseas slave labor. If the issue is cost of manufacturing, you're making my point for me. The whole reason raw manufacturing here is \"inefficient\" comes down to one thing, and that's energy costs.\n\nWe've spent the last few decades crippling our own power grid because everyone was first, scared of nuclear power because of lobbying from the oil industry, and then got sold on solar panels and wind turbines as the future. They're not. They're unreliable, they don't scale worth a damn, and they've driven electricity prices through the roof for industrial operations. You have to build an entire secondary grid and distribution system just to stabilize power output when we have a few cloudy days.\n\nNoranda paid more for electricity than entire cities. You know what would've fixed that? Cheap, abundant baseload power. Nuclear power. We could've built reactors decades ago and had some of the lowest industrial energy costs in the world, but instead we let fear-mongering and red tape kill the one energy source that actually works at scale.\n\nI don't want to outsource our manufacturing to what can very easily become our enemies in the next war. You want raw manufacturing to be affordable, You want finished goods to be cheaper. The answer is for both of us to start lobbying for nuclear plants.\n\nBuild enough of them, and suddenly that aluminum smelter in New Madrid doesn't look so inefficient anymore. Raw materials become cheap to process here, your downstream manufacturers get cheaper inputs, and we stop depending on shipping lanes that can get cut off the second a real conflict starts or *one* freighter manages to block a canal.\n\nRemember the Ever Given? That cargo ship that got wedged sideways in the Suez Canal back in 2021? It was stuck for six days. Six days, and it cost the global economy around $400 million an hour; that's nearly $10 billion per day in delayed trade. The US had hundreds of containers stuck. Everything from pharmaceuticals, furniture, raw materials for construction and manufacturing were being imported here. Isn't that insane to you? Companies couldn't get the parts they needed, production lines slowed down, and prices went up because nobody could predict when their shipments would actually arrive.\n\nThat was one ship, one canal, and one accident. Now imagine what happens when it's not an accident. When an adversary deliberately targets shipping lanes or blockades chokepoints during a conflict. We're completely dependent on those supply lines staying open, and we've gutted our ability to produce the raw materials we'd need to keep running if they get cut off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI'm not making these arguments in a vacuum. I come from a region that's been absolutely devastated by this kind of thinking. Southeast Missouri used to have real industry. Lumber mills, manufacturing plants, smelters like Noranda. Now? The people here are in abject poverty. Not because they're lazy or uneducated, but because men in suits who never worked a day in their lives decided it was more profitable to shut everything down and move operations overseas.\n\nGideon Anderson Lumber Company used to be one of the biggest employers in this area. It's gone now. The mill's been closed for years, the equipment sold off or left to rust. The people who worked there? They're working retail jobs if they're lucky, if not, they're still here, aimless, usually addicted to whatever shit they can find to numb themselves from their depressing surroundings, living in run down shacks that were once strong economic sectors. You can look at Detroit as another example. \n\nOne small town in the center of the USA, employing at most 250 people in their plant, was the largest supplier of military crates in the **nation**. Just one small town was able to contribute so much that our stamps are still on most of the crates you can find from the war. Now Gideon has a poverty rate of nearly 30%.\n\nEntire towns just like ours have been hollowed out because someone in a boardroom decided short-term profits were worth more than the long-term stability of American communities.\n\nThey didn't account for what happens when those supply chains break. They didn't account for what happens when the countries we've outsourced to decide they don't want to trade with us anymore. They just looked at quarterly earnings and made their decisions accordingly. Now we're left holding the bag, dependent on foreign manufacturers for everything from basic materials to finished goods, and we've lost the knowledge and infrastructure to make those things ourselves. The people overseas have essentially, all of the leverage to set prices to whatever they want. We can't go anywhere else, we're fucked.\n\nThat's what outsourcing has cost us. Not just jobs, but entire communities, entire skill sets, and our ability to stand on our own when things go wrong. And they will go wrong eventually. They always do. We were **only** able to supply Europe in the World Wars when we were manufacturing everything **here**.",

Then you need the skilled people -- that aren't available. It will take a generation to reactivate manufacturing in the US via tariffs. \nMy feeling is that because we can't get cheap EVs from China and other hitech equipment - we will get left behind.

At the time, margins were still strong, demand wasn’t a question mark, and the story made sense. One of my core filters has always been management quality, and even then Elon was already a concern, but the numbers backed the thesis.\n\nFast forward to now and I finally pulled the trigger. Not because of politics, not because of vibes, and not out of spite. I ran the models again, reread earnings, looked at demand curves, margins, capex, and guidance. The thesis I originally bought no longer exists. Add in a CEO I don’t trust, constant distractions, and attempts to blur the lines between Tesla and his other ventures, and I couldn’t justify the risk anymore.\n\nYeah, I left a lot on the table and I might regret it if robotaxis magically fix everything. But I sleep better knowing my capital isn’t tied to something that now relies more on hope than execution. Gains don’t matter if the risk profile quietly changes under your feet.",

Yes, it had some rough edges, but not enough to justify the extra $120,000. Plus, some of the Chinese automakers are giving them 10 year warranties! Far better than what any other automaker is offering, and for that price, who gives a fuck if the car is a basket case in 3-4 years? It costs 1/5th the price of a comparable car from the Germans, and is totally incomparable to anything the Americans can make at any price. Just buy 4 more when the one you have breaks down, instead of bothering with the 10 year warranty.\n\nTesla simply won't be able to compete, which is why they're getting their ass kicked in China.",

Moves like these with no solid reasoning behind them can only go down so much, its simply a technical reversal that needed to happen.

There is a lot to be annoyed by but I'm a bull for the foreseeable future.\n\nRemember to stay invested!\n\nEdit: If you're going to be one of the ones saying how this market index is down 3% or this one is down 1.5% just keep scrolling.

            "body": "It seems irrational, but here's an actual answer: Commodities, IE, companies selling products with high competition, command low valuations because competition lowers margins and it is easier for new competitors to come in, increasing risk. All these companies Mag7, software, were not priced like commodities, but as if nobody can compete with them. There is a high risk this is not true in the future.\n\nWe know one specific model, Anthropic's, is currently ahead in coding tools. However, all these models are somewhat the same, even those open source from China. So they are commoditized.\n\nWe know new coding tools seem to make programming easier, SWEs less relevant, any single software less relevant because it's becoming easier for new software to come online. That makes software commoditized.\n\nThe market is currently questioning, the capex of all these new data centers, of all these new coding tools, do not actually make the incumbents better off, what it does is makes AI consumers better off. For example it's like solving cancer. If a company has solved cancer without any patent protection, all other companies can copy it. However, since all companies can now copy it, and there were previous health solutions relying on cancer not being solved, it actually makes all companies worse off, especially if all these companies are spending trillions copying each other, except for healthcare consumers.\n\nIn this analogy, Anthropic, to a lesser extent free Chinese open source, is the one solving cancer, Mag7 are all the companies able to copy the process, the health solutions relying on cancer not being solved are the software companies. The neoclouds are a proxy of Mag 7 without the Mag 7 diversification.\n\nWhy would the market reward companies to spend trillions developing a great thing yes, but a great thing that is essentially free and competing with open source?\n\nSo who are the beneficiaries? Clearly the beneficiaries are AI consumers, and AI picks and shovels because everyone trying to copy/one up each other increases the use of tools necessary for AI development. This includes the semiconductors, which have obviously outperformed, and anyone currently paying money for things AI can do easier. This also isn't software, but companies using legacy or past software that AI has made easier, so a lot of main street companies that buy software. Of note are Alphabet and Meta. Alphabet and Meta are actually both in part \"AI consumers\" because of ads and social media. Social media ecosystems such as Youtube and Instagram, with greater AI usage and consumption, increases engagement and thus increases ad incentive, which is why they have outperformed.\n\nThe clear AI consumer in Mag 7, Apple, is a winner in this environment, its the most stable of them, adopting a wait and see approach in the current AI battle, and can simply eventually pick the winner, and if there are many winners, pick the cheapest winner. As apps are also a type of software and arguably the easiest to \"vibe code\", usage of Apple's app ecosystem will also increase.",

So you are onto something when you say the models may get commoditized sooner rather than later without further breakthrough in technology.\n\nI still think the big winner is Google at the end of the day.

If you know how to use them (been using since Opus 4.5 dropped in November) you can't beat it and I'll be big on people getting lapped.\n\nI work with Codex at times, with 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 when they come out, but they're not close to as good and with Opus 4.6 plus the other features they've added to Claude (subagents, easier to document and keep context), Anthropic is way ahead and has momentum for building things perspective.\n\nThe issue is I see comments on reddit and HN for engineers who are oblivious to this in some way. Think they're better than AI rather than realizing that software engineers need to switch to product manager roles and know what you're trying to build and for who.\n\nWhat this means for investment, not sure. For my work as data engineer, I can rewrite things and get the data going all on my own and not have to pay ever again for things like Fivetran. Pretty much any software only service can be rewritten (for my stack) with postgres, FastAPI, React, Tailwind, shadcn, docker and any linux machine. I have my \"studio\" setup with these conventions and exmples where I can come up with product or feature change and the model knows what tools to use and can go and do it. Still requires manual help with making sure the overall plans are correct, which means engineers won't go away, but we're more engineering a solution rather than writing code. Lucky for me because code itself was always the brain drain burnout producing step.\n\nSo SaaS companies alone are really going to be no more, if and when the majority of engineers realize they should go all in. Get teams of two probably, who are considered at least Seniors, know how to use Claude Code, and act as product managers overall, and they'll replace entire 8 person teams and get useable code in a hundredth of the time.

Because the quality of code they put out isn't very good (though, I would argue, it's better than the quality you get out of Claude Code).

But you're going to run into a brick wall very quickly.  \n\nThe AI might know how to write javascript and CSS, but it doesn't know how to architect a scalable system.  It doesn't know about data residency requirements, multi-region deployments, GDPR or SOC2 or PCI compliance.  It doesn't know about load testing and security and FedRAMP.  It doesn't know about efficient schema design and materialized views and pipelining.  It doesn't know about deployment trains and monitoring / observability tools.\n\nAnd then after you write your Salesforce Killer, you're going to have to host it, but as a startup, you're going to be paying a LOT more to AWS than the big SAAS companies are.  A company spending eight figures a month at Daddy Bezos' Cloud Emporium is going to be able to negotiate a significant discount, but Barbara's CRM Solutions Inc isn't.\n\nAnd even if you figure all that out, you're going to be left with a product full of mediocre code and a company full of engineers who don't understand the code they're writing.\n\nOh, and here's some more inside baseball: We (people who work in software at big, publicly traded tech companies headquartered in Silicon Valley) are all already using AI.  Through my employer, I have a github account with unlimited copilot - any agent, including claude.  I am actually encouraged to use AI to help code (it is pretty good at writing unit tests, I'll grant).  But, saying that agentic coding is a force multiplier, and then only allowing for applying that to plucky startups that are seeking to dethrone Salesforce is crazy - Salesforce is already using AI as a force multiplier.  At best, the plucky startup is moving at the same velocity.  They're not faster.  And they're only cheaper because they lack feature parity.\n\nI swear, all of this \"Companies that don't realize AI changes everything have already lost\" sounds ... eerily familiar.  It almost sounds like \"Companies that don't realize the metaverse changes everything have already lost\".  Or \"Companies that don't realize blockchain changes everything have already lost.\"",

Everyone thinks they can do better because of friction between the engineers and management. The code ends up being bloated and buggy and there are features customers are clearly asking for but the company doesn’t want to implement. \n\nAnd most of these people have always talked about doing it themselves. You hear lots of “next time I want to try going at it myself. Start my own company”. Of course it never really materializes. Most people start a side project as a proof of concept of what they’re thinking and it kinda ends there. I personally have a graveyard of git repos I started and abandoned. \n\nNow let’s say one of my ideas in the graveyard is actually good. What am I supposed to do about it? It needs to be finished and launched. But I’m already working at the SAAS company. I have no time. I’d have to be coding every day, get off work, and code some more. This is how projects end up in the graveyard. \n\nOf course I could do what you’re saying. Hire a team at $1.50 and have them build it for me. But that gets expensive fast. And you have timezone issues. And language issues. And how confident am I that they’ll deliver what I want how I want it? Not very. Their coding style could be very different. It’s just not a very practical approach. \n\nAll of a sudden AI comes. I’m paying for it anyway for personal use. Now I can have it pick up some graveyard project and work on it on my personal computer while I’m working. Guess what? I actually deployed projects from my graveyard that have been there for years. Now I don’t have to code all day, get off work, code some more. Now I can get off work and spend an hour or so just doing code review. It’s a lot slower than a global-south team.

In a couple of years I don’t think it’s unreasonable to imagine a coding agent that can take a task and work on it for a full day.

As a result, there's been margin based unwinds by leveraged institutions everywhere, and great AI companies are getting sold off to meet margin requirements for Metals.\n\nIf you want free money, buy good AI companies right now, they are all on massive discounts (and will continue to be) as we watch Gold and Silver melt down.",

            "body": "Here is an economics/ finance perspective:\n\nYou're not wrong that it looks contradictory, but there are a few structural things going on that explain it.\n\n**Most of these stocks were just expensive.** When people say a stock is \"expensive\" they don't mean the share price is high, they mean the price relative to what the company actually earns is stretched. That's measured by the P/E ratio (price to earnings). A lot of these names were trading at 30x, 40x, even 60x+ earnings. That means investors were paying $40-60 for every $1 of profit, betting that growth would eventually justify that price. When confidence wobbles even slightly, the market re-rates them. The company can be doing fine, but the market decides it's no longer willing to pay 40x and marks it down to 25x. That alone can be a 30-40% drop with zero change in fundamentals. That's called multiple compression, and it's what's hitting both groups right now.\n\n**Interest rates make this worse.** Growth stocks are valued on future earnings. When interest rates are higher, those future earnings are worth less today in present value terms. So the maths behind the valuation literally changes even if the business doesn't. This hits high-P/E tech disproportionately hard regardless of whether the company is an AI builder or an AI \"victim.\"\n\n**Passive investing amplifies everything.** A huge amount of money now sits in index funds. These funds buy and sell based on market cap weighting, not fundamentals. That means the biggest tech names get bought simply for being big, and when sentiment turns, they get sold for the same reason. It doesn't matter that NOW and NVDA are completely different businesses — they're in the same indices, held by the same funds, and sell together when money flows out.\n\n**In sell-offs, correlations breakdown**. This is a well-known pattern. When investors de-risk, they sell what's liquid and what's gone up the most. During risk-off periods, correlations across stocks spike toward 1. Fundamentally unrelated companies drop together because it's the same money exiting, not because the market has a coherent view on each individual company.\n\nSo in your example.\n\nThe incumbents like NOW, ADBE, CRM aren't getting wiped out. They're getting repriced. There's real competition from AI-native tools, margins might compress, growth might slow, but these are massive businesses with deep customer lock-in and switching costs. A price correction is not the same as going bust.\n\nThe AI infrastructure companies aren't a bubble in the dot-com sense either. The spend is real, the revenue is real, and the demand for compute isn't slowing. Think of them less like speculative bets and more like electricity providers: everyone needs the infrastructure, and these companies are building the plumbing. Many of them are also diversified businesses (GOOG and META aren't pure AI plays, they have enormous ad businesses generating cash regardless).\n\nBoth can drop at the same time because the market isn't making a coherent argument. It's a bunch of different actors repricing risk, unwinding crowded positions, and adjusting to rates, all at once. The contradiction you're seeing is the market being a market, not the market being right about two opposite things.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** Both groups were overpriced and are getting repriced at the same time. That's not the market making two contradictory arguments: it's passive funds, rate sensitivity, and risk-off selling hitting all expensive tech together regardless of fundamentals.",

The SAAS companies also have been making investments in AI and need to prove it helps their revenue and margins, but at the same time investors are scared they will lose their moats. MSFT, AMZN, GOOG drops are mostly related to CapEx vs actual results/returns for AI.  The rest of the AI fear is really based on NVDA 100 Billion deal stalling with OpenAI.  OpenAI needs as much money as possible so that really hurts them, which hurts Oracle because Oracle needs 300 Billion from Open AI over the next 5 years.  Also OpenAI not being satisfied with some Nivida chips, and the two companies recently came out in great lengths to ensure the public and investors that their are no Issues between them.   \n\n  So AI stocks would still be likely tanking off of OpenAI/NVDA/ORCL/CRWV without the Anthropic news, and it would perhaps would affect SAAS a bit, but it sure wouldn't be the SAAS apacolypse that is occurring now.

        "selftext": "One of the things that people have been complaining about is that the major indicies are at historic highs as far as the Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E). So far this week all the major players who have high P/E's, they have all been reporting GREAT results, better earnings. But the stock price is falling so why is that good? \n\nBecause the P/E is falling. If you missed GOOG last year it dropped to a P/E below 15 and people realized that was oversold. Currently MSFT is around 25 so maybe it falls further.\n\nSo earnings are good and unemployment remains historically low (the recent challenger layoff report aside, I think what we are seeing is there are people in the workforce who have been waiting for layoffs and simply now retiring (read r/fire for more), that's why unemployment isn't rising. I have a friend who was thrilled when Bridgestone had major layoffs, he started another company years ago but was waiting for the big bag to officially leave).\n\nI'm not saying that the marketing is going to go straight up from here. February is historically a poor month. What I am saying is what everyone knows and yet everyone seems to find every excuse not to do:\n\nBuy Low, Sell High. \n\nThis is an opportunity to buy, not sell.",

If you think about an SMA strategy like a 200 or 220 or 250 day, fairly long lookback, most high volatility days cluster beneath the SMA line and thats when you get out of levered positions. DVQQ/SP went down to ~50% exppsure during april, but they took a while to catch the rebound and missed some of the biggest days when trump would rugpull tarrif expectations. Then during the nice low vol summer they went almost 2x exposure and regained a lot of lost ground.\n\nBut to me, WEBs is just solving the wrong problem with these products, and the fact that it costs 0.96% makes them worthless. Not to mention the costs of the swaps when they go long leverage. For reference, even a simple 220day SMA -/+1% buffer that switches between 100% QQQ and 50/50 QQQ/Cash did 4% higher CAGR than DVQQ since its inception, and going 2x vs 50/50 depending on the SMA signal still did 2%cagr better over the timeframe (had to eat that 40% QLD drawdown into liberation day).\n\n\nSome bad things about the company from their prospectus:\n\n\"The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has not approved or disapproved these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Prospectus.\"\n\nAnd Syntax's website is hard to find since they changed their name to WEBs ETF trust.\n\nIn sumary:\n\nDVQQ is going to delist, I can almost guarantee it.\n\nThey dont even have 4M AUM after a year. They have produced *higher* volatility than QQQ for half the CAGR while charging 0.96% ER vs QQQM at 0.15%. Also theyre not even kosher with the SEC yet.\n\nDVSP will almost certainly delist for the same reason.\n\nWEBs is a small hack shop riding the wave of niche over financialized ETF offerings charging 0.6-1.1 ER for things like options buffering, covered calls, vol targeting, put spread inclme, etc. All of these are bad.",

Do you regret buying, or do you still believe in the company long term and see this as just part of the ride?\nFor those who didn’t buy, does it feel like you dodged a bullet, or are you starting to think this might be a good chance to get in at a much lower price?

They called out Claude and Cursor as if they were the same, but I figured they meant \"a model within cursor\" and just ran with it. \n\nI'm curious what sort of design files the LLMs will spit out if I point them at our design system. Then again, where the heck are you supposed to host your design system if not Figma? I guess major corporations would love it if none of it was human  interactable other than the chatbot. That's a doomsday scenario as far as I'm concerned, where the machine is the only thing left that knows how anything actually works.\n\nEdit: I also want to point out that this sort of workflow might work for a small, 6 page website, but it's definitely not going to work well for an Enterprise level website, with thousands of pages, each with hundreds of possible configurations, across multiple projects. It's just not. AI can barely keep track of a single conversation without extensive MD notes. I loathe the idea of it being responsible for an entire design system and enterprise web presence. It forgets or just doesn't care to account for known browser gotchas and issues on a single file. That would result in hundreds of bugs across thousands of pages if an engineer didn't wrangle it back into submission.\n\nEdit 2: I just asked Claude to evaluate my project scripts and it told me there are no class-based components. Almost all of our components are class-based. It's far from a perfect solution.",

            "body": "I can't tell you if Figma's balance sheet makes it a buy. I can tell you it has become the most used tool in design in enterprise and design agencies. I have been working in arts and design for 20 years and seen industry standard software been replaced. Everyone used to use Quark, until InDesign took over. I used to predominantly use Photoshop or Illustrator on a daily basis. I barely open those unless I have to do something Figma can't do...yet, and if I do, I use it for a second doing something hyperspecfic and then I import it into Figma. Product designers used to use Sketch. Now they use Figma.\n\nIt is the best collabrative software I've ever used. There are things it can not do today, that I still need Photoshop or Illustrator for. And things it can do much better.\n\nFigma is trying to be the everything app. It is trying to be PS, Illustrator and it's competing with WiX, Squarespace, Framer, AI, Google Slides, Keynote, Slack... They have a way to go to still get there. The question is do you think they can capture these markets and how much of them?\n\nEDIT: For those talking about moat, I challenge you to think about a few things. 1. Internally getting people to learn new software is challenging and expensive. One of the things I would knock on Figma is it's expensive. Most places I've worked at have limited seats.\n\nThe other thing I would think about is UX and efficiency. Here is where Figma shines and kicks Adobe's ass. Adobe focuses on acqusitions and new software. But in over a decade they can not seem to get their software to talk one another seamlessly, or to unify commands and behaviour cross platform. It's insanely bad and frustrating. You can do the exact same thing in PS, Illustrator and Premiere or whatever and use completely different commands and menus.\n\nIn an Adobe workflow, people design in Adobe (with no collaboration they have to pass files around) and build presentations in another program like Google Slides (which sucks unbelievable ass—it's like using software from the 90s).\n\nIn Figma you can design and build presentations just by switching tabs. Test things with a touch of a button. And show off a prototype on a remote video software with a click. It can export multiple files, cleanly in different formats in just a click. Its integration of plug-ins is built directly into the software. It’s so easy to use and find. People who aren’t designers can easily learn simple tasks within the software where they can, for example go get files on their own or export them easily without having to bother Designer to do it. You can make audio calls from it. It is so effecient, easy and integrated. You need four pieces of Adobe software or other software to do what Figma can do.\n\nDesigners, developers, copywriters, account people and clients can all do their respective jobs efficiently from one piece of software. Creating more efficiency, less confusion and less churn.\n\nNothing else can do that.\n\nFigma is making the iPhone. While Adobe, Google, and Apple are making the Blackberry.\n\nAdobe should be what Figma is. It can not do it. Becuase it doesn't invest in unifying its software. It just puts out updates so fast, that you end up with 4 versions of software, where you don't know what the difference is, and features you don't use because the changes outpace your ability to either read or learn  them.",

The only reason I say \"for the most part\" is because our current designer doesn't seem to know how to use it properly, so he sets shit up in a way that none of the useful features like measuring attributes and padding are measurable, but he thinks he knows what he's doing.

Last week the Claude Code AI model update utterly crashed the stock of the software companies that employ hundreds of thousands of us, who have already been spooked, or actually fired, by the recent massive layoffs at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, META, and others. \n\nSome are actually unemployed now and cashing out to pay their very high bills, but even the majority of us who are still employed know our jobs are under threat from AI and are preparing our finances for the worst.\n\nTech Bros scared -&gt; Bitcoin crashes\n\n\nEdit - for people downvoting the phrase \"tech bro\" I am one, I work in big tech, and my job is at risk too.

The reframing from internet currency to store of value happened because Bitcoin core devs had a large amount of infighting over this exact issue and the \"store of value\" group won over the \"internet currency\" group.

Its price can fluctuate wildly based on everything from [market manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984) to [random tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522006333).  No reliable store of value should vary in \"value\" 10-30% in a single day, yet many cryptos do.\n\n 3.  Crypto's value is *extrinsic*.  Any \"value\" associated with crypto is based on popularity and not any material or intrinsic use.  See this [detailed video debunking crypto as 'digital gold'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&amp;t=4446s)\n\n 4. Extrinsic vs Intrinsic value - Some argue \"all value is subjective\" - this is false, and a philosophical distraction. Certain things are intrinsically valuable because whether people believe in them, they are needed, like fresh water, real estate, food, etc.  100% of crypto's value is subjective/extrinsic.\n\n 5.  Even gold, while being a lousy investment and also an undesirable store of value in the modern age, at least has material use and utility.  Crypto does not.  And whether you think gold's price is not consistent with its material utility, if that really were the case then gold would not be used industrially.  But it is. Furthermore gold's extrinsic value is a product of its intrinsic properties: if it weren't oxidation resistant, it wouldn't be suitable for jewelry. So even when arguing gold's value is more based on popularity, you can't escape the value of its unique material properties being a component of that popularity. Crypto has no such intrinsic component. So it's inappropriate to compare the two.\n\n 6.  The supposed \"value\" of crypto is based on reports from unregulated exchanges, most of whom have been caught [manipulating the market](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21) and [inflation introduced by unsecured stablecoins](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).  There's nothing \"organic\" or \"natural\" about it.  It's an illusion.\n\n 7.  The operation of crypto is a negative-sum-game, which means that in order for bitcoin/crypto to even exist, there must be a constant operation of third parties who must find it profitable to operate the blockchain, which requires the price to constantly rise, which is mathematically impossible, and the moment this doesn't happen, the network will collapse, at which point crypto will cease to exist, much less hold any value.  This has already happened to tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies.\n\n 8. The \"Network Effect\" argument is just the [Appeal to Popularity Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) - Just because something is popular does not make it inherently valuable. Especially if that popularity is primarily based on marketing and coercion and not actual material utility or intrinsic value.\n\n 9. Many of the most trusted, most successful entities in the world of finance do not consider crypto/bitcoin to be a reliable store of value.  Crypto is [prohibited from being used as collateral by the DTC](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2024/4/26/B20002-24.pdf) and respectable institutions such as Vanguard [do not believe crypto belongs in their investment portfolio](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think).\n\n 8.  There is not a single example of anything like crypto, which has no material use and no intrinsic value, holding value over a long period of time across different cultures.  This is **not** because \"crypto is different and unique.\"  It's because attributing value to an utterly useless piece of digital data that wastes tons of energy and perpetuates tons of fraud,*makes no freaking sense* for ethical, empathetic, non-scamming, non-exploitative, non-criminal people.",

So UNLESS/UNTIL you can actually liquidate your crypto for actual real money, you have no idea what you have. You're \"down\" until you cash out.  Bernie Madoff's clients got monthly statements saying they were \"making money\" too.\n\n7.  Just because it's possible (though highly improbable) to make money speculating on crypto, this doesn't mean it's an **ethical** or reliable technique to amass wealth.  At its core, the notion that buying and holding crypto will generate reliable returns is [a de-facto ponzi scheme](https://ioradio.org/i/ponzi/).  **It's mathematically impossible for even a stastically-significant percentage of crypto holders to have any notable ROI.**  The rare exception of those who might profit in this market, do so while providing cover for everything from [cyber terrorism](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3026.html) to [human trafficking](https://humantraffickingfront.org/cryptocurrency-use-in-the-online-sexual-exploitation-of-children/).\n\n8.  It's also not true that anybody who bought crypto when it was low is guaranteed to make a lot of money.  There are thousands of ways people can lose their crypto or be defrauded along the way. And there's no guarantee just because your portfolio is \"up\", that you could easily cash out.\n\n9. While crypto suggests itself as an alternative to \"TradFi\", the [most respected and successful people](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-predicts-bad-ending-bitcoin-it-doomed-investment) in traditional finance who have proven track records of good investing/returns [do not think crypto is a reliable store of value](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think).\n\n10.  Want to see a better asset (that actually has utility) that's consistently out-performed Bitcoin?  [Here you go](https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22253079/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price-2021).  However, this may be another [best performing asset](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/declaration-of-financial-independence/).  \n\n11. When crypto-critics make reference to, or mock crypto price predictions, it's not because we think price is a meaningful metric.  Instead, we are amused that to you, that's all that's important, and we can't help but note how often wrong you are in your predictions.  The intrinsic value of crypto basically never changes, but it is interesting to see how hype and propaganda affects the extrinsic value.  In a totally logical world, those would both be equalized to zero, but we're not there yet, and nobody knows when/if that will happen because it's an irrational market.",

But it being a confidence index specifically for tech people seems long outdated.\n\n2018 is when Bitcoin broke into mainstream consciousness. And I mean mainstream in the literal sense - Ellen DeGeneres did a spot on her then-popular show about what Bitcoin was and why people should know about it - there are many other examples but the fact is that people well outside of tech knew about Bitcoin during this time. At that point you have a massive influx of people who wanted to participate in the latest get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nWe've gone through at least 3 different iterations of crypto trying to find its footing in terms of utility and longevity since that point. Making it a new currency, making it a store of value like gold, and making it a store of ownership with NFTs. I don't actually know what narrative drove its recent rise outside of \"regulations will be lax with this new government, time to pump!\" And I've wondered for about the last year what exactly would compel anyone to keep buying crypto, it looks like it's the same drivers as its initial mainstream runup 8 years ago - just a whole lot of random folks hoping it will get to $1 million/coin in the near future. That doesn't take tech bro understanding or money, anyone with some cash lying around can jump on that ship.\n\nSo, going on 8 years after crypto broke into the mainstream, I'm pretty sure that vast majority of owners are \\*not\\* the tech bro crowd even if there is a sizable amount of tech bros invested in the space. Bitcoin is highly volatile, highly prone to market manipulation, highly prone to big sell-offs. It has plummeted and sky rocketed \\*many\\* times in its history. ",

This scaled collat requirements with contract value, effectively capping leverage as it goes higher. The capital required to maintain a single COMEX contract increased in tandem, creating an environment where even minor price drops would trigger massive margin calls. Jan 27th: CME had increased the maintenance margin percentage twice this week to ensure \"adequate collateral coverage\" amid extreme volatility. This forced leveraged positions to liquidate their long positions or post substantial additional capital. There were five margin hikes within nine days that created a \"coiled spring\" of potential selling pressure. Today: Western markets focused on the Federal Reserve, but the new Fed chair likely did not play much of an impact as this is just noise. Pricing dislocations happened in Asian markets. UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund traded at 36-64% premiums over SHFE contracts. And this was the main source of silver exposure in China. On January 30, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange implemented an emergency full-day trading halt for the SDIC Silver LOF. This suspension created a \"liquidity trap\" for Chinese institutional and retail traders. Unable to liquidate their domestic holdings, these participants were forced to dump [$SLV](https://x.com/search?q=%24SLV&amp;src=cashtag_click) and COMEX futures to raise cash or hedge their exposure. TLDR: The [$SLV](https://x.com/search?q=%24SLV&amp;src=cashtag_click) crash of January 30, 2026 today was not a failure of silver's fundamental value, but a failure of the \"paper game\" that dictated price discovery. CME hiking margin requirements repeatedly and the China liquidity trap led to cascading margin liquidations that caused selloffs of leveraged positions. Other events such as the Fed chair was likely known awhile, looks to be \"narrative noise\" regarding what actually happened. Today was a \"Paper Game\" failure and leverage used to trade it was systematically wiped out by exchange rules.",

They tend to hit hardest when positioning is already crowded and liquidity is thinner than it looks on the surface\n\nIn that sense, the CME changes and the China liquidity trap explain the acceleration, not necessarily the initial vulnerability. Once leverage is embedded across regions, it does not take much to turn a repricing into a disorderly unwind\n\nI agree that pinning this on a Fed nomination is lazy storytelling.

Exchanges made repeated attacks on metals and it kept going up, they got pissed and their 5th attack or greater finally had an impact.\n\nAlso, China did the same with a gold fund today and froze trading all day today. And, if you look at the 2/2/26 chart for UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF it dropped 10% on open and stayed flat all session.

When products trade at persistent premiums, issuance is halted, and leverage is embedded across venues, the system becomes extremely sensitive to any restriction on liquidity. Once one valve closes, pressure shows up everywhere else.\n\nFrom the exchange perspective, raising margins and freezing issuance is often described as risk control. In practice, doing it mid cycle tends to amplify volatility rather than contain it. It forces participants to react to rules instead of prices, which is how orderly markets turn disorderly.\n\nThe flat trading after a large gap down fits that pattern. It suggests price discovery was interrupted rather than completed. When markets reopen under those conditions, they often move again, not because fundamentals changed, but because positioning is still being resolved.\n\nThis is why blaming any single announcement misses the point. What we’re seeing looks like a leverage and liquidity reset in paper metals, not a reassessment of silver or gold themselves.",

SpaceX advisers have sought index policy changes that would fast-track its entry into major indexes for the company and benefit other highly-valued private companies, the people said.               \n                          \n&gt;Last valued at $800 billion, SpaceX is targeting a valuation of more than $1 trillion, a listing that would become the largest-ever U.S. IPO.         \n      \nAlso worth noting that Elon Musk is seeking changes to the 6-month lockout period after a company IPOs so he can liquidate some of his SpaceX stock more quickly after the IPO.       \n       \nI think this is interesting in terms of how eager people might be to participate in SpaceX's IPO but I think the much ",

They can't compete with non-existent dealers, so no laws are broken.\n\nAt least that's Tesla's argument in court. They have both won and lost cases (they cannot sell cars in several states due to this). The legal precedent set by Tesla has enabled other new age manufacturers like Rivian and Lucid to engage in direct sales as well, but Ford and other legacy automakers are stuck with their dealers.\n\nEDIT: that said, there has been talk about Ford potentially spinning off its EV manufacturing into a separate company, partially with the goal of skirting these dealership commitments for EVs. Don't think it's actually happening though.",

Tesla isn't the only car company without dealerships, it's just the biggest car company without dealerships.\n\nThe other car companies can sell direct to consumers, but they'd have to get rid of their dealerships first in most states because they'd be competing against them. And the dealership system is so entrenched that this is basically an impossible task for them.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that Tesla had to exploit a bunch of insane loopholes for their direct to consumer offerings in a lot of states because of all the idiotic restrictions on it. I think in Texas for example Tesla still has to ship cars made in Texas out of the state and record the sale as having occurred in a different state whenever they sell to people in Texas, because Elon didn't think to try to flex his muscle to force Texas to change their idiotic laws as a precondition of getting the Texas factory and it's jobs.",

CVNA is probably the worst offender. PLTR is a solid company(in terms of growth), but its valuation is so extreme that index investors are getting a lousy deal.\n\n- Total market index funds are essentially funding garbage companies. Because they fund based on market cap weights, if a company  issues a lot of new shares, the fund has to keep buying more and more. This makes at the market programs really successful. Microstrategy is a really good example. For the longest time, it made no sense to buy them at a premium to book value when you could just buy Bitcoin instead. But index funds kept eating up their shares.\n\n- Because of this, companies that are aggressively buying back shares are being oversold by index funds. This is because stock buybacks make the index fund overweight, so it has to sell them off to equalize weights with the company that is issuing lots of new shares.",

Examples include [**Snowflake**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Snowflake&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1144US1144&amp;oq=have+there+been+publicly+traded+companies+that+have+received+a+waiver+on+the+6+month+lockout+period&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTExMDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC7a3zxMKSAxV378kDHYqPGKgQgK4QegQIARAB) (90 days), [**Airbnb**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Airbnb&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1144US1144&amp;oq=have+there+been+publicly+traded+companies+that+have+received+a+waiver+on+the+6+month+lockout+period&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTExMDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC7a3zxMKSAxV378kDHYqPGKgQgK4QegQIARAC) (7-day window), and [**Robinhood**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Robinhood&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1144US1144&amp;oq=have+there+been+publicly+traded+companies+that+have+received+a+waiver+on+the+6+month+lockout+period&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTExMDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC7a3zxMKSAxV378kDHYqPGKgQgK4QegQIARAD) (15% at IPO). These early releases, often facilitated by underwriters, are becoming more common. \n\nKey examples and trends regarding lock-up waivers:\n\n* **Notable Exceptions:** In 2020, Snowflake, Inc. allowed employees to sell shares after just 90 days rather than 180, and Airbnb, Inc. provided a 7-day window for employees to sell up to 15% of their vested options.\n* **Robinhood's Approach:** Robinhood’s IPO featured a unique structure allowing employees to sell 15% of their shares immediately at the IPO and another 15% at the 90-day mark.\n* **Common Scenarios:** Underwriters or boards of directors often waive lock-up periods if the IPO performs well, or to align with earnings-related blackout periods, such as in cases with [**Lyft, Inc.**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lyft%2C+Inc.&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1144US1144&amp;oq=have+there+been+publicly+traded+companies+that+have+received+a+waiver+on+the+6+month+lockout+period&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTExMDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC7a3zxMKSAxV378kDHYqPGKgQgK4QegQIAxAD), [**Pinterest, Inc.**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pinterest%2C+Inc.&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1144US1144&amp;oq=have+there+been+publicly+traded+companies+that+have+received+a+waiver+on+the+6+month+lockout+period&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTExMDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC7a3zxMKSAxV378kDHYqPGKgQgK4QegQIAxAE), and [**Peloton Interactive, Inc.**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Peloton+Interactive%2C+Inc.&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1144US1144&amp;oq=have+there+been+publicly+traded+companies+that+have+received+a+waiver+on+the+6+month+lockout+period&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTExMDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC7a3zxMKSAxV378kDHYqPGKgQgK4QegQIAxAF).\n* **Purpose of Waivers:** These, known as \"early lockup releases,\" are often permitted to prevent a massive, simultaneous sell-off of stock when the restriction period expires, which can cause extreme volatility or share price drops. \n\nWhile standard 180-day lock-ups are common, they are not regulated by the SEC and are contractual, allowing boards and underwriters to adjust them. ",

It Was Positioning Colliding With Policy.\n\nFriday’s selloff across precious metals was not a simple “risk-off / risk-on” flip.\n\nIt was a positioning unwind, triggered by a sharp repricing of U.S. monetary policy expectations and amplified by options mechanics.\n\nThe Trigger: A Dollar Shock, Not Inflation Data\n\nMarkets were leaning heavily into a weaker-dollar narrative.\n\nThat changed abruptly when reports confirmed that Donald Trump would nominate Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair.\n\nWarsh is viewed by markets as one of the most hawkish figures among the finalists. His past record shows persistent concern about inflation and skepticism toward balance-sheet expansion.\n\nThe immediate implication:\n\nStronger dollar\n\nLess tolerance for financial repression\n\nReduced enthusiasm for policy-engineered asset inflation\n\nThat was enough to pull the rug from under crowded precious metals trades.\n\nWhy Gold and Silver Fell So Hard\n\nGold dropped more than 12% intraday — its largest one-day decline since the early 1980s.\nSilver collapsed by as much as 36%, an all-time intraday record.\n\nThis wasn’t just macro. It was structure.\n\nOver the past year, metals had attracted:\n\nHeavy trend-following inflows\n\nSignificant speculative length\n\nLarge call-option positioning at round-number strikes\n\nAs prices surged, options dealers were forced to hedge by buying futures and ETFs, mechanically reinforcing upside momentum.\n\nWhen prices reversed, that same mechanism worked in reverse.\n\nThe Gamma Effect\n\nLarge options positions were clustered around:\n\nGLD ETF strikes near $465 and $455\n\nCOMEX gold options around $5,300, $5,200, and $5,100\n\nAs gold fell back through these levels, dealers had to sell into weakness to rebalance exposure.\n\nThis created a classic gamma squeeze in reverse:\n\nFalling prices → forced selling → accelerating downside\n\nVolatility didn’t cause the move.\nVolatility amplified it.\n\nWhy Silver Was Hit Even Harder\n\nSilver is structurally thinner and more volatile than gold.\n\nOnce the unwind began:\n\nLiquidity disappeared faster\n\nMargin pressure escalated\n\nRisk models forced systematic de-risking\n\nThe result was an exaggerated move relative to gold, despite similar macro drivers.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: This Was a Regime Test\n\nEven after Friday’s collapse:\n\nGold still finished the month up ~13%\n\nSilver was still up ~19%\n\nThat tells you something important.\n\nThis wasn’t the end of the precious metals trade.\nIt was a stress test of how crowded it had become.",

Usually rates and balance sheet are treated as linked. They work together. He sees them as very seperate.\n\nThat will likely scare every market, except dollars, until people actually make sense of what this new regime is like.

I peak stocks with a very specific scenario which still have a risk, but this risk is not based in rumors.   \nAn example are the go-private stocks. In such stocks, someone (in the best cases more than one and the insiders included) have made a go-private proposal to a higher than the price I bought. I may need a lot of time to wait in a environment where the suitors of the company (insiders or not) try to scare retail investors to make them sell, but I'm market-proof by 90%.   \nTo be more specific: BARK Inc. received two offers in cash to go-private, one by its management at $0.90 and one preliminary by a third part group at $1.10. BARK stock trades around $0.84 now.   \nThe insiders proposal will be approved easily from the Special Committee, they actually are the same team.   \nThe other suitors' group will confirm their proposal after Feb. 15th they will complete their DD. In this group participates also a minority holder, a fund.   \nSo, no matter what the market, NASDAQ, gold, crypto will do in the next two months, I'm investing in an almost certain $0.90 and a very possible $1.10 by buying it around $0.84.

Companies are no long sitting on mountains of cash, or returning it to shareholders, they are plowing it straight into physical infrastructure. \n\nWhat's most interesting about this, is that all of these tech companies who had mostly presented themselves as software companies with low overhead and unlimited growth and scale potential, are waking up to the reality that if they want to compete in the AI space (which they have all identified as a critical existential threat to their future), they need to invest in the physical infrastructure to do so. AI development has shifted, and it is going to come down to who has the most transistors under roof. \n\nWe live in a scare world, in that, there is only so much capacity to go around for the things that go into data centers. From the compute chips, to the workers and material needed to pour concrete and lay wire, to the amount of energy required. If you don't have a shovel in the ground yesterday, and you don't have your future commitments lined up and ironclad, you will never be able to catch up. \n\nAI, love it or hate it, has completely shifted the landscape we knew for the past 30 years. With that said, I ponder these thoughts:\n\n- Has the Fed been battling inflation with the realization that the largest companies have been collectively holding back trillions of dollars for decades, that are all of sudden spending it all at once and as quickly as possible? What are the ripple effects from having all that money injected into the arteries of the world's economy?\n\n- What happens if AI turns out to be a dead end, and AGI is never solved? Can these large companies make a return on their investments? What happens if they can't?\n\n- What happens if AGI is solved? Everyone has defined this race as a zero sum game, and right now the S&amp;P500 is very crowded at the top with those who are competing in it. Were talking tens of trillions in market cap. \n\n- In a gold rush, sell a shovel. Who are the shovels? What exactly goes into a data center? As you keep taking it apart piece by piece, you find that the depth and breadth touches the vast majority of all industries, the greater sum of human production. Is it healthy for the global economy to optimize towards data center construction? \n\n- Where is all this energy going to come from?",

It’s also often misunderstood because people often focus on the headline power number without digging further. \n\nRoughly half of bitcoin mining power uses renewable energy, and a large share uses stranded or curtailed energy (hydro overflow, flared natural gas, excess wind/solar). Miners can locate anywhere, instantly turn on/off their power, and monetize energy that would otherwise be wasted. That makes Bitcoin one of the few industries that can actually improve renewable project economics rather than compete with households. See Texas as an example, where miners participate in demand response programs by diverting energy towards the grid during high demand stress periods (heatwaves/winter storms)\n\nBitcoin’s energy use also does not scale with transaction count. It scales with the value being secured. That makes it closer to a global settlement layer than a retail payments network. If Bitcoin succeeds as a currency, most transactions will likely occur on layer 2 solutions (eg lightning network) to handle high throughput, while the base layer will serve as the settlement layer. Similar to how Fedwire operates in relation to retail payment systems.\n\nYou can argue the security isn’t worth the energy cost (I’d disagree but that’s a legitimate and subjective debate). But energy usage alone doesn’t make it nonviable, especially when much of that energy is otherwise unusable and the system self adjusts with price and mining incentives",

I would regard this as short-term noise in a long-term trend, since this drop came after it rose up quite a lot in the previous 2-3 years.\n\nBut now, Kevin Warsh's nomination as the Fed Chair shakes up these fundamentals - as he has expressed opinions in the past that he is against fiat money printing, and plans to actually _reduce_ money supply by shrinking the Fed's Balance Sheet. It's unlikely that he would be able to actually do so - but if more people with such views start influencing monetary policy around the world, fears of monetary debasement could subside... And I consider this as a negative for Bitcoin, as well as gold.\n\nIn a world where governments are fiscally responsible and don't excessively print money out of thin air, Bitcoin would be much less useful and valuable.

It’s so frustrating though when you buy a stock or ETF, hold it and then decide for whatever reason to sell it and then it rallies. I’m talking rebalancing, you realize maybe it was a poor decision to begin with or you just didn’t have it in the right account, etc. I could list many, but recently, SCHD sold at $27.11. EPD sold at $31.51. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had winners and losers. It’s just really frustrating going from something that has traded flat and then you sell and then it almost immediately starts taking off. I don’t actively trade anymore and invest only in ETF’s to hold, but damn sometimes it feels like the market is working against you. Am I the only one? ",

You should not buy it or sell it because of its price. Form a hypothesis about the stock. Determine what your measures are for whether or not the hypothesis is correct, and invest in that hypothesis. If you are wrong about your hypothesis or measurement you could lose money. You could also make money while being completely wrong. When you determine that your plausible hypothesis has been fulfilled, then determine a new one for whether or not to buy or sell.\n\nYour personal financial pressure will determine whether or not you sell stocks for other reasons. Then you make your best guess to sell based on financial need. \n\nIt can feel punishing. It's not. The market is agnostic to your existence. The market also moved for unknown reasons, despite a lot of people claiming to know.\n\nIt's important to not think of your financial investments as part of your own narrative about success or failure. \n\nMy personal example: I invest in ETFs through my IRA. In any given month or week I could have looked at the numbers and created a story about my own failure or mistakes. Instead I just kept following my hypothesis. I'm up 29% in a year. I don't  I did better on my individual trading account. But that is also the first thing I turn to when  I need to sell for money. So the growth has stopped. \n\nMy first hypothesis: I invest in companies that make a product that I like and that I like interacting with. My biggest loss was first Republic bank.\n\nI've been burned for a few thousand dollars on all the meme and crypto nonsense. \n\nMy second hypothesis. The truth is by the time it reaches the Internet for big gains, it's already in the dump phase of the pump and dump. I've lost on amc, GameStop. I've sold too early on almost everything. \n\nAnd I'll tell you from private conversation that a lot of crypto is completely corrupt and unregulated insider trading.",

House Representatives only win 38% of their trades with negative average returns, while Senators do slightly better at 43% wins but that's still worse than a coin flip. The really wild part is financial sector trades - congresspeople average -14.5% returns when buying bank and financial stocks, with 58% of those trades going negative. Tech purchases actually work out well (+71% average returns), but the financial sector timing seems impossible even with policy knowledge.\n\nOnly 27% of lawmakers fall into the high-performing tiers, while 64% consistently underperform in the low tier.

Like writing summaries for reports of what I've been doing.\n\nI also use it for coding. But there is no case where the work it does is up to an experienced engineers standards. It's not maintainable, it still takes a lot of time to review, especially because of the nasty \"looks right but actually isn't\" types of bugs it loves to introduce, and you end up taking a fair bit of time, trying to make it produce the code you want. I'd say at most you get 10-20% of an increase in output for development, and studies have gone anywhere between 0-40%, BUT it does take a big mental load off on tedious tasks(but you still need to review them) and you can use it to bounce ideas off, kind of like rubber ducking, and sometimes it does suggest good alternatives, so I do quite like using it, just think that it requires a careful and skilled operator that checks its work.\n\nI'm sure it helps more in some stuff(like writing reports that no-one actually reads, hah!), like prototyping ideas, but where quality matters, the time taken to make sure its output is up to snuff costs nearly all the full gains.\n\nAnd the rate of improvement is fast plateauing out. Which isn't surprised as it's only as good as its teacher.\n\nThen there's structural problems in the whole business(hardware depreciation cycles) that all make it pretty sketchy. It'll certainly stick around, but I'm thinking we're going to have a dotcom bubble moment with it where the initial hype dies down, and then it grows more sustainably afterwards",

I had it export everything as a collection of json files and then had it wrtite another script to generate nicely formatted PDF's out of each json file and group everything into directories along with signed contract files that were all dumped into a separate export folder.
