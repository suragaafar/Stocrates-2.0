## Core Principles

### Educational First
- **Goal**: Teach concepts, not provide trading advice
- **Approach**: Every interaction is a learning opportunity
- **Outcome**: Users develop their own analytical skills

### Historical Pattern Analysis
- Analyze similar past events to show how markets reacted
- Transparent similarity scoring
- Learn from history without making predictions

### No Predictions or Recommendations
- ❌ Never make buy/sell recommendations
- ❌ Never predict future prices
- ✅ Show historical patterns and multiple outcomes
- ✅ Include disclaimers and encourage independent research

---

## Configuration

### News API Fallback System

The app includes an intelligent fallback system:
1. **Primary**: NewsAPI (100 requests/day free tier)
2. **Secondary**: Finnhub (60 requests/minute free tier)
3. **Tertiary**: Reddit sentiment data
4. **Fallback**: Mock data (never fails completely)

### Reddit Scraping Options

**Option 1: TypeScript Scraper** (Fast, no auth)
```bash
pnpm run scrape:reddit
```
- Uses Reddit's public JSON API
- No authentication required
- Scrapes posts only (no comments)

**Option 2: Python Scraper** (Comprehensive, recommended)
```bash
python scripts/scrape-reddit-with-comments.py
```
- Scrapes posts AND all comments
- Better stock mention detection
- More accurate sentiment analysis
